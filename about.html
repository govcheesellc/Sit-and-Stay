            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Founded by Bailee Williams, Sit and Stay Pet Care is a labor of love born from a lifelong passion for animals. 
                Growing up surrounded by dogs, cats, birds, horses, pigs, and more, Bailee's journey began with dog sitting for 
                friends and family. Her love for animals—especially farm animals—sparked a dream to turn this into something bigger. 
                A pivotal experience working at a vet clinic and boarding facility during college deepened her expertise, though she 
                chose not to pursue veterinary medicine, realizing her heart was too invested to handle its challenges. Instead, she 
                channeled her love into Sit and Stay, helping pets and their owners with personalized care.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bailee's first dog, Roxy, a birthday gift at age 4, shaped her dedication. Roxy was her constant companion, and 
                caring for her during family trips ignited Bailee's passion for pet sitting. This personal connection drives her 
                to treat every dog like family, a value at the heart of Sit and Stay.

            <h2>What Makes Us Unique</h2>
            <p>
                Sit and Stay isn't your typical dog-sitting service. Bailee goes above and beyond, offering meticulous care, 
                planning, and constant updates with photos to ensure your fur baby is thriving. She views pets as family members, 
                tailoring every visit with detailed knowledge of their medical, behavioral, and personal needs. From walks and 
                feeding to playtime, she spoils each dog, building a bond that shines through their unique personalities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bailee loves establishing friendly, open relationships with clients, creating a laid-back yet communicative atmosphere. 
                Her favorite part? Watching dogs' personalities emerge and forming quick, heartfelt connections with them.

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>
                Pet sitting is just the beginning for Sit and Stay. Bailee plans to expand by hiring employees, enabling them to 
                build their own client bases and extend services to other cities. Her ultimate dream is to create a sanctuary for 
                kill shelter and slaughterhouse animals, giving them a retirement home to roam free fields. Sit and Stay aims to 
                evolve into a dual-purpose business—rescuing pets without owners while supporting those with loving families. If a 
                client faces hardships and needs to surrender a pet, Sit and Stay is committed to helping.
            </p>
            <p>
                Community is key. Bailee's initiative tackles shelter overcrowding by promoting adoptions, assisting with 
                transportation to overcome distance barriers, and supporting local shelters. For pet owners, Sit and Stay offers 
                peace of mind—whether for a date night or a trip—building a trustworthy relationship where you can focus on 
                yourself without worry.
