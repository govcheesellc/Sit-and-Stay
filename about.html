            <h2>Meet Bailee Williams</h2>
            <p>
                Hi there! I'm Bailee Williams, the founder and heart behind Sit & Stay Pet Care. Based in Allen, Texas, 
                I've dedicated myself to providing exceptional, personalized pet care services to families in our community 
                and surrounding areas within a 10-mile radius of ZIP code 75002.
            </p>
            <p>
                My passion for animals began at an early age, and over the years, I've developed a deep understanding of 
                what pets need to feel safe, comfortable, and loved when their families are away. Whether it's a quick 
                daily check-in or an extended overnight stay, I treat every pet as if they were my own.
            </p>

            <h2>Why I Started Sit & Stay Pet Care</h2>
            <p>
                <em>[Placeholder: Bailee's inspiration story will be added here based on her answer to: 
                "What inspired you to start Sit and Stay Pet Care?"]</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                I started Sit & Stay Pet Care because I believe every pet parent deserves peace of mind when they're away 
                from their furry family members. After years of experience working with animals and seeing the stress that 
                pet owners face when leaving their beloved companions, I knew I could make a difference by providing 
                reliable, loving, and professional pet care services.

            <p>
                What I love most about this work is building lasting relationships with both pets and their families. 
                There's nothing quite like the joy of seeing a dog's tail wag when I arrive, or receiving a heartfelt 
                thank-you message from a pet parent who knows their furry friend was in loving hands.
